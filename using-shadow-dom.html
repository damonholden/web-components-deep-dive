      <h2>Using The Shadow DOM</h2>
      <p>An important part of web components is encapsulation, meaning, being
        able to keep the structure, style, and behavior hidden and separate from
        other code on the same page, so that there is no clashing. The Shadow DOM
        is a key part of this, providing a way to attach a hidden separated DOM to
        an element.</p>

      <h3>High-level View</h3>
      <p>the Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in
        the regular DOM tree. A shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root, under
        which you can attach any element in the same way as the normal DOM</p>
      <object data="./img/shadow-dom-high-level.svg" width="100%"></object>
      <p>To be clear, there is terminology within the shadow DOM concept to be
        aware of:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Shadow host:</dt>
        <dd>The regular DOM node that the Shadow DOM is attached to.</dd>
        <dt>Shadow tree:</dt>
        <dd>The DOM tree inside the Shadow DOM.</dd>
        <dt>Shadow boundary:</dt>
        <dd>The place where the Shadow DOM and the regular DOM are separated.</dd>
        <dt>Shadow root:</dt>
        <dd>The root node of the Shadow tree.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>You can affect nodes in the shadow DOM in the exact same way as nodes in the
        regular DOM - for example, appending children, settings attributes,
        styling individual nodes, or adding a <code class="tag">style</code> element
        to add styling to the entire tree. The difference is that none of the code
        inside a shadow DOM can affect anything outside it, creating
        encapsulation.</p>
      <!-- TODO: find out if encapsulation works both ways -->
      <p>Note that the shadow DOM is not a new concept - browsers have used it
        for a long time to for the inner structure and encapsulation of built-in
        elements. The <code class="tag">video</code> element with the <code>controls</code>
        attribute is a good example of
        this:</p>
      <video controls width="100%">
        <source src="./videos/car-forest.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <p>With devtools open, all you can see in the DOM is a <code class="tag">video</code>
        element, but it contains buttons and other controls in it's shadow DOM.
        The difference in custom elements is that you are allowed to actually
        create your own shadow DOMs for them, which can actually be viewed in
        the browser's devtools.</p>
