      <h2>Using The Shadow DOM</h2>
      <p>An important part of web components is encapsulation, meaning, being
        able to keep the structure, style, and behavior hidden and separate from
        other code on the same page, so that there is no clashing. The Shadow DOM
        is a key part of this, providing a way to attach a hidden separated DOM to
        an element.</p>

      <h3>High-level View</h3>
      <p>the Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in
        the regular DOM tree. A shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root, under
        which you can attach any element in the same way as the normal DOM</p>
